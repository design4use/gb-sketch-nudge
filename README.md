## Updates
##### Jan 27, 2015
* Changing shortcut to ctrl shift to avoid conflict with move to back/front
* Auto-updating inspector

## Description
For those who want more then just nudging by 1px (arrow keys) or 10px (shift + arrow keys). For example in a recent project things were usually moved in multiples of 16px. This plugin saved hours.

ctrl-shift plus  ↓ ← ↑ → to nudge the selection by n pixels, where n is any number.
ctrl-shift-0 (zero) is used to change this number.

Preserves last used value across sessions.
