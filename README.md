# gb-sketch-nudge
Quick nudge by a customizable number of pixels

For those who want more then just nudging by 1px (arrow keys) or 10px (shift + arrow keys). For example in a recent project things were usually moved in multiples of 16px. This plugin saved hours.

Cmd-opt plus  ↓ ← ↑ → to nudge the selection by n pixels, where n is any number.

Cmd-opt-0 (zero) is used to set this number.

Preserves last used value across sessions.
