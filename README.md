Quick nudge by a customizable number of pixels

For those who want more then just nudging by 1px (arrow keys) or 10px (shift + arrow keys). For example in a recent project things usually are moved in multiples of 16px. This is let me set this, and it's a huge timesaver.

Uses cmd-opt plus arrow keys to nudge the selection by n pixels, where n is any number. An additional cmd-opt-0 (zero) is used to set the number
